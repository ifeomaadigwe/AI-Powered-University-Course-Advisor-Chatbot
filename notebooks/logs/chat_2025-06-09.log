Please refer to LMU’s official website for more detailed information on the admission process.


Suppose we have a new international academic staff member at LMU Munich. This person has been accepted as a doctoral candidate and is in the process of applying for admission. They have asked the academic advisor for the details of the documents required for admission. 

From the conversation, we know that the documents required are:
1. Official Transcripts
2. Personal Statement
3. Recommendation Letter from their current supervisor.

Let's denote these documents as T, P, R respectively. Furthermore, let's suppose that our new colleague has already sent their transcript and personal statement to the academic advisor but is unsure if they have included a recommendation letter.

According to the conversation, if the applicant has sent their transcript and personal statement, then they must have sent their recommendation letter:
T \u2227 P \u2192 R

However, our new colleague is unsure if they have sent their recommendation letter. This means that we can’t directly establish whether T \u2227 P is true or false.

Applying the property of transitivity (If A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C), we cannot conclude that R is true, i.e., our new colleague has sent the recommendation
